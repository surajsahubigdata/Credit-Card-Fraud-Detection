This project aims to develop a real-time fraud detection system for credit card transactions using machine learning models such as Isolation Forest, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees. The objective is to identify and flag suspicious transactions that deviate from normal behavior patterns, helping financial institutions to prevent fraudulent activities. The models are trained on a dataset of historical transactions, where they learn to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent behavior. The system's performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure high accuracy in fraud detection while minimizing false positives. This solution is designed to enhance the security of credit card transactions and protect customers from fraud.
